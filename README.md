I'm an enthusiastic helper and action-oriented doer that likes to see people smile because they just did something awesome! 😎

At work, you'll find me building frameworks and core (software) technologies for promoting energy transition and carbon out. [#HackThePlanet](https://youtu.be/5y_SbnPx_cE?si=zVgh4UdteKI6D6cp) I'm also a *pushy* advocate for our developers at Baker Hughes and I try my best to organize our GitHub organization [@bh-ent-tech](https://github.com/bh-ent-tech). I'm also x2 pround to be the tech guru and events leader of our employee advocacy groups, LatinX. Our volunteers are the best!

### 🏢💚 If you're a colleague
I'm always happy to provide another set of eyes or fill in that gap of "you don't know what you don't know".

Ask me about:  
**🏅 Coding Best Practices** - Particularly Python, Javascript-based, and C#.  
**📖 Documentation Best Practices** - It's like the gym. We all know it should be done, but we don't actually do it every day. Just do it! ✅  
**🐙😺 GitHub** - Pretty much anything, like really... I probably have an API example already ready for you. 😉  
**⚔️ Cybersecurity** - Definitely not an expert, but we should always be learning more here. Especially with AI going mainstream!
